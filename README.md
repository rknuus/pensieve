# pensieve
pensieve (in German: Denkarium) hopefully develops into an aid to organize your thoughts based on the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) by Niklas Luhmann. Unlike other Zettelkasten implementations our aim is to support organizing your thoughts the same way you organize your personal library. E.g. I prefer to organize my books by topics. When searching a book I roughly know where to look for it. So pensieve will allow to organize Zettelkasten boxes and Zettels by position.
